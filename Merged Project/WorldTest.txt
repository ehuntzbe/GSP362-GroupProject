Who wakes somebody up with a sword. \n Melonos: Somebody that needs his apprentice up to make the most important \n delivery in an old man's life.\n Apprentice: You mean that it's ready. The ultimate weapon you made for the king.\n Melonos: Yes my boy, the Dark Gun is complete. Now put some pants on and deliver it before we both die of old age. You put on your clothes, pick up your personal magitech sword and head out the door.\n Melonos: Good luck my boy, say hi to the king and queen for me. Try not to look stupid in front of the princess. \n Apprentice: Thanks, try not to fall asleep while working and accidentally set    your beard ablaze. \n Melonos: That only happened once. Also you must remember to never use the Dark    Gun. Don't even play with it. It is meant to bond to its first user until they die.

You see that the path here ends at a cliff. \n You are at the end of the path and can plainly see many of the buildings in Mogan and the castle. As you look two large beasts pop up from the mountain. A large red cyclops and a blue cyclops that seem to be merged with magitech weapons. The red ones right hand has been merged with a large magitech sword. The blue ones left hand has been merged with a magitech gun.\n Apprentice: Oh my god, these things are huge. It looks like they have magitech attached to them.\n Red Cyclops: Rooooooooooooo\n Blue Cyclops: Rooooooooooooo\n Apprentice: Ok, I guess cyclops don't speak.\n The red one swings his sword arm and attempts to hit you, while the blue one aims his gun at you.

Mogan Kingdom 
You are now at the kingdom of Mogan. The building glistening with light. The streets are empty as it is night. You can still see Mogan Castle in the distance. A glowing jewel of light surrounded by smaller lights. At a distance it's like it was forged from gold. But like everything else it is light barrier magitech.\n Apprentice: Wish I had time to get a good look around. This place is great. The magitech here is almost as good as Dartosks. Plus the food is cooked in special magitech light barrier pans and tastes great.

It may even be just as powerful. Last I heard it was called the Sword of Light.\n Just as the word light escapes your lips two men come from an alley and attack.\n Mogan Guard A: In the name of the king you will fall boy.\n Apprentice: Our kingdoms are friends, why is your king trying to kill me.\n Mogan Guard B: We don't know, although he did say we would be allying with some new kingdom.\n Mogan Guard A: Carl, shut up.\n Mogan Guard B: Dude, dont tell him my name.\n Mogan Guard A: Sorry, Carl.

Even offer jobs to those willing.\n Apprentice: And now?\n Gilven: Now he has them killed. The man we all respected has been replaced by a monster.\n Apprentice: I may be able to help. Your kingdom seems to have been taken under the influence of something called the False Kingdom. Led by a man know as The False.

Follow me.
